Sinatra Kickstart Template
==========================

In short: Sinatra template, active record based, classic style, startout app with extensions that can be added or removed.

Concept:
This is a compact version of a complete application with all the code, written in simple understandable form, for you to see how it works, and learn from it.
All of the concepts covered in this application (like the display of all of the SELECT sql queries) are intentional.
The main idea is to make a basic skeleton application but not as startout as most of the templates out there.
In the end, this application framework skeleton will have several extensions which can be added or completely removed,
so if you need a typical application that has blog posts and comments, you can include the ready made extension on the fly without any additional work.
As this application is intended to tacle such obstacles which are rather tacled by the help of rails,
this application is mostly suited for familiarizing yourself with the concepts ready-made in the rails framework.
If you have troubles learning of the rails framework, I would strongly advise you to dive into the code of this application,
as I found more answers here that on most of the tutorials. (They are not useless but this venture was more productive for me.)

Current main version: 0.1 alpha

Blog extension version: 0.1 alpha

Please use this application at your own risk! It is not done yet!

Please also note, that for this application I used the code of the sinatra-activerecord gem, because normal use did not work. I will edit the license later accordingly.
